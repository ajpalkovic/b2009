Archons only get 1 energon per turn
Changing direction takes one round
6000 bytecodes per round, and .1 of the leftover is added to energon
Only move 1 block at a time

Worker:
	While true:
		Parse any messages (map data)
		Find nearest flux desposit we own
		Find nearest block
		Compute path to that block
		If it has enough energon to get there and back: (keep in mind it will get lots of yield bonuses)
			Go to block
			Make sure block is still there (can be doing this each step of the way)
			Load block
		Return to flux desposit
		Unload block
		Get energon
	Can only load/unload a square that is +/- 2 away
	Goal should be to get 6 blocks per flux
		First 2 blocks: 1
		Third block: 2
		Fourth block: 2
		Fifth block: 3
		Sixth block: 3 GOAL
		Seventh block: 4
	Worker might not be able to return to flux deposit cuz it can only climb 2 height w/ a block

Soldiers:
	Check if enemies are near
	Check if one of our robots is being attacked
	Check if it should be defending flux
	Soldiers should double team enemies
	Channeler:
		Have to be guided
		Can't constantly drain - 0.1 energon loss
		Do absorb .1 of its attack damage
		
Archons:
	Transmit their location in grid
	Based on number, go in 6 different directions
	Transmit new locations
	When they find a flux deposit, send a message to the other archon
	Each archon builds a worker, channeler, and scout, fills their energon and gives them all map info
	Save a reference to those spawned robots?
	
	Tell spawned units all their map info
	Give energon to units who want it
	Burn flux to double energon production 300 flux for 100 extra energon
	Spawn workers and soldiers
	Find an unowned flux deposit
	Each archon will start at a specific location in a 3x2 square which can give them their initial direction
	Should stay in radio range of each other
	Once a flux deposit is found, archon's should search a bit more and then double team it, make scouts to search
	Make 2 workers and a channeler quickly

Scout:
	Get map data from all 6 archons
	Explore map
	When low on energon, go to nearest archon and refill
	Go to the other archons and give each of them the map data

Energon transfers:
	Fill up the robot's energon reserve, and then each turn 1 energon from reserve moves to the main energon level

Messages:
	Have an 8 tile radius
	Only broadcast new squares?

Map System:
	Mod x and y by 60 and return that index

How can soldiers move when the map changes so much
Relay attack messages to soldier
	What if the relayer dies
Some sensor methods seem like they do not need the robot to be in range
Is attack bonus added to or multiplied to the attack power

Add start to open
while open not empty:
current = lowest cost square of open
if current == goal, done
else
move current from open to closed
for each square s adjacent to current:
if s is traversable, s not in open, and s not in closed
compute cost of s
add s to open
