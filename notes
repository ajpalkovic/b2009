Archons only get 1 energon per turn
Changing direction takes one round
6000 bytecodes per round, and .1 of the leftover is added to energon
Only move 1 block at a time
  
  
Worker:
	While true:
		Parse any messages (map data)
		Find nearest flux desposit we own
		Find nearest block
		Compute path to that block
		If it has enough energon to get there and back: (keep in mind it will get lots of yield bonuses)
			Go to block
			Make sure block is still there (can be doing this each step of the way)
			Load block
		Return to flux desposit
		Unload block
		Get energon
	Can only load/unload a square that is +/- 2 away
	Goal should be to get 6 blocks per flux
		First 2 blocks: 1
		Third block: 2
		Fourth block: 2
		Fifth block: 3
		Sixth block: 3 GOAL
		Seventh block: 4
	Worker might not be able to return to flux deposit cuz it can only climb 2 height w/ a block

Soldiers:
	Check if enemies are near
	Check if one of our robots is being attacked
	Check if it should be defending flux
	Soldiers should double team enemies
	Channeler:
		Have to be guided
		Can't constantly drain - 0.1 energon loss
		Do absorb .1 of its attack damage
		Perform an attack every fourth turn and see if the channeler gains some energy
		
Archons:
	Transmit their location in grid
	Based on number, go in 6 different directions
	Transmit new locations
	When they find a flux deposit, send a message to the other archon
	Each archon builds a worker, channeler, and scout, fills their energon and gives them all map info
	Save a reference to those spawned robots?
	
	Tell spawned units all their map info
	Give energon to units who want it
	Burn flux to double energon production 300 flux for 100 extra energon
	Spawn workers and soldiers
	Find an unowned flux deposit
	Each archon will start at a specific location in a 3x2 square which can give them their initial direction
	Should stay in radio range of each other
	Once a flux deposit is found, archon's should search a bit more and then double team it, make scouts to search
	Make 2 workers and a channeler quickly
	
	At beginning:
		split in 3 groups of two and go in 3 different directions, each team of 2 should stay in radio range
		code:
			scan 8 surrounding cells to get position
			scan all cells to get map data
			change direction
			move one cell
			setup map
			
Scout:
	Get map data from all 6 archons
	Explore map
	When low on energon, go to nearest archon and refill
	Go to the other archons and give each of them the map data

Energon transfers:
	Fill up the robot's energon reserve, and then each turn 1 energon from reserve moves to the main energon level
	Deal with multiple energon requests

Messages:
	Have an 8 tile radius
	Only broadcast new squares?
	Types:
		unit under attack
		enemy in sight
		flux deposits
		sync newly spawned units
		request energon
		new map heights
		sync map
		ping - request and respond
	Relay messages
	Extend MapLocation class
	Use archons as router - when a robot comes in for energon, the archon should give it all its map data and the robot gives the archon its data
	Have a scout that travels between archons syncing data

Map System:
	Mod x and y by 60 and return that index

How can soldiers move when the map changes so much
Relay attack messages to soldier
	What if the relayer dies
Some sensor methods seem like they do not need the robot to be in range
Is attack bonus added to or multiplied to the attack power

Attacking
	gang up?
	unit ratio and count?
	retreat time?
	send archons?
	build up terrain?
	
Directions
	Go method:
		recalculate path
		repair path when obstructed
		canMove method to take care of walls
		when a wall is discovered, set a map variable indicating modded index and actual index of the wall
	Path method:
		use sensors for blocked tiles
	
Methods
	findBlock, loadBlock, unloadBlock
	sendMessage, relayMessage, processMessage
	senseNewTiles
	attackMethods
	
Workers
	have to find / remember stuff
		need to sense map to find the best location to place this block
		have a build stairs state / meta info?
	what if no blocks in range?
		have boolean for wheter there are more blocks at previous location
		if none, search in increasing radius
Archons
	send 3 archons to go towards thje flux, only 1/4 should capture it
	if path is obstructed rotate until free
	form archon group - all archons broadcast id if they want to join
	select lowest of the ids and join
	lowest id gets to capture it
		change for first to arrive at it
	when captured, spawn

Status Codes: 
A unit, when pinged can return one or more of these codes - there are status codes and then there are action codes
A unit might want to be queried, so that if a unit is too far away to update, another unit can ping it when it is back in range
to find out where it is and its status. We can use these codes for appropriately dealing with situations.
A random id will be created and broadcast on the first turn.  All subsequent messages must include it to distinguish our messages.
Syncing map info:
	Only send the new cells.  When new map tiles are added, they will be timestaped with the current turn (the coordinates of each cell updated will be stored in an array indexed by that time stamp)
	map info is 3 ints, 2 for the coordinates, and 1 for tile info like terrain height, block height, and contains flux

   so broadcast when status changes or when pinged.
   broadcast message ints[0] should ALWAYS be the source robot's ID
   
   LOW_ENERGON (has less than 25% energon) //status, sent when pinged
   UNDER_ATTACK (has been attacked in the past 100 turns) (enemy type, enemy energon level) //broadcasted initially, and sent as status when pinged if has been attacked for past 100 turns
   ENEMY_IN_SIGHT (can see an enemy) //broadcasted  (how many enemies and enemy types)
   FLUX_IN_SIGHT (can see flux) //broadcasted  (parameter is location)
   NEW_UNIT (type of unit location on map maybe unique id) //broadcasted
   MAP_INFO  //broadcasted
   PING //maybe only archons use this?
